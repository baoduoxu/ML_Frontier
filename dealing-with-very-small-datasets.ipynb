From the <code>mlxtend</code> library documentation:\n","\n","> Stacking is an ensemble learning technique to combine multiple classification models via a meta-classifier. The individual classification models are trained based on the complete training set; then, the meta-classifier is fitted based on the outputs -- meta-features -- of the individual classification models in the ensemble. The meta-classifier can either be trained on the predicted class labels or probabilities from the ensemble.\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafjaa/curso-mineracao-de-dados-aplicada/master/img/kernel_overfitting/stack.png)\n","<center><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=\"http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/classifier/StackingClassifier/\">http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/classifier/StackingClassifier/</a></center>\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","As an example, we will use the <code>StackingClassifier</code> of the <code>mlxtend</code> library:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"metadata":{"_uuid":"90a2afb30f624565faa6d2f7a6e04220003b0938","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Accuracy: 0.17\n","           0         1  weighted_pred  stack_pred\n","0   0.323382  0.927266       0.462740    0.965638\n","1   0.343512  0.783370       0.445018    0.919928\n","2   0.285169  0.802717       0.404603    0.924592\n","3   0.385279  0.774348       0.475064    0.907825\n","4   0.288949  0.885959       0.426721    0.956797\n","..       ...       ...            ...         ...\n","82  0.274859  0.259346       0.271279    0.210692\n","83  0.382790  0.347897       0.374738    0.346494\n","84  0.310626  0.696536       0.399682    0.847727\n","85  0.263868  0.513275       0.321424    0.597857\n","86  0.360869  0.551930       0.404960    0.653779\n","\n","[87 rows x 4 columns]\n"]}],"source":["from mlxtend.classifier import StackingClassifier\n","\n","m = StackingClassifier(\n","    classifiers=[\n","        LogisticRegression(),\n","        XGBClassifier(max_depth=2)\n","    ],\n","    use_probas=True,\n","    meta_classifier=LogisticRegression()\n",")\n","\n","m.fit(X_train, y_train),\n","preds['stack_pred'] = m.predict_proba(X_test)[:,1]\n","preds.head()\n","\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_auc_score\n","\n","accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, preds['stack_pred'].round())\n","# precision = precision_score(y_test, preds['stack_pred'].round(),average='weighted')\n","# recall = recall_score(y_test, preds['stack_pred'].round())\n","# f1 = f1_score(y_test, preds['stack_pred'].round())\n","# roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_test, preds['stack_pred'])\n","\n","print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')\n","# print(f'Precision: {precision:.2f}')\n","# print(f'Recall: {recall:.2f}')\n","# print(f'F1 Score: {f1:.2f}')\n","# print(f'ROC AUC: {roc_auc:.2f}')\n","print(preds)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"04c653c3e5b8380b2e297be67865b516022dc6b5"},"source":["![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafjaa/curso-mineracao-de-dados-aplicada/master/img/kernel_overfitting/mem2.jpg)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"f8a97a205f557f6cd475e067a8ee953ec5f52e87","trusted":true},"source":["<h1 id=\"t7\">References</h1>\n","\n","**Overfitting:**\n","* IRIC's Bioinformatics Platform.
